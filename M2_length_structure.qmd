## Alternative methods for including length data in age-structured assessment models

### Stock Synthesis 3

This method is used in Stock Synthesis 3 (SS3; Methot and Wetzel, 2013) and was recently implemented in the ["growth"](https://github.com/GiancarloMCorrea/wham/tree/growth) branch of the Wood's Hole Assessment Model (WHAM; Stock and Miller, 2021; Correa et al., 2023).

Predicted catch-at-age and -length for year $y$ and fishery $f$ are calculated using element-wise multiplication

$$
\hat{C}_{y,f,l,a}=\phi_{y,f,l,a}S_{y,f,l}S_{y,f,a}F_{y,f}N_{y,a}\frac{(1-\text{exp}(-Z_{y,a}))}{Z_{y,a}}
$$

where $N_{y,a}$ is the abundance-at-age $a$ during year $y$, $Z_{y,a}$ is the total age-specific mortality, $F_{y,f}$ is the fleet-specific annual fishing mortality, $\phi_{y,f,l,a}$ is the fleet-specific age-length transition matrix (i.e., the proportion of fish of age $a$ in length bin $l$), and $S_{y,f,l}$ and $S_{y,f,a}$ are the selectivity-at-length and selectivity-at-age, respectively. When $S_{y,f,a}$ is used, $S_{y,f,l}$ is set to a matrix of 1s of the appropriate dimensions. Similarly when $S_{y,f,l}$ is used, $S_{y,f,a}$ is set to a matrix of 1s.

Note that $Z_{y,a}$ is age-based and relies on the calculation of total age-based fishing mortality $F_{y,a}$, which in turn relies on age-based fishery selectivity. Therefore, when selectivity-at-length is used, it must first be converted to selectivity-at-age using the dot product of selectivity-at-length and the transpose of the age-length transition matrix:

$$
S_{y,f,a}=S_{y,f,l}\cdot\phi_{y,f,l,a}^\top
$$

This implied fleet-specific selectivity-at-age is used to obtain $F_{y,f,a}$, which can be summed across fleets, and combined with natural mortality to obtain $Z_{y,a}$ for use in the predicted catch-at-age and -length equation above.

The predicted abundance index-at-age and -length for year $y$ and index $i$ is obtained using

$$
\hat{I}_{y,i,l,a}=\phi_{y,i,l,a}S_{y,i,l}S_{y,i,a}N_{y,a}\text{exp}(-f_{y,a}Z_{y,a})
$$

where $f_{y,a}$ is the fraction of the year when the survey was conducted.

The predicted catch-at-age $\hat{C}_{y,f,a}$ and catch-at-length $\hat{C}_{y,f,l}$ is calculated as

$$\hat{C}_{y,f,a}=\sum_{l}\hat{C}_{y,f,l,a}$$

and $$ \hat{C}_{y,f,l}=\sum_{a}\hat{C}_{y,f,l,a} $$These are converted to predicted proportions-at-age and proportions-at-length (i.e., marginal age and length compositions, respectively):

$$
\hat{p}_{y,f,a}=\frac{\hat{C}_{y,f,a}}{\sum\limits_{a}{\hat{C}_{y,f,a}}}
$$

and

$$
\hat{p}_{y,f,l}=\frac{\hat{C}_{y,f,l}}{\sum\limits_{l}{\hat{C}_{y,f,l}}}
$$

Predicted survey age and length marginal compositions are obtained in an identical fashion.

<mark>**IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:** This method has a proven track record estimating growth (**cite**), fitting to numerous types of size-based data (e.g., marginal length compositions, conditional age-at-length), and estimating both length-based and age-based selectivity functions. **TODO_NATHAN: benefit can specify both age and length base slx functions, example, exploratory red snapper model**. The known drawbacks occur when length-based selectivity is used or when growth is estimated; the standard normal cumulative density function used to generate the age-length transition matrix will result in a dense matrix, that when multiplied by other quantities will result in inefficient calculations. Giancarlo tried to use `Eigen::SparseMatrix` to alleviate this issue in [WHAM](https://github.com/GiancarloMCorrea/wham/blob/3af37de1566f3a99b967901e540d81ef70f613a0/src/helper_functions.hpp#L1456), but it did not help. For Milestone 2, $\phi_{y,f,l,a}$ and $\phi_{y,i,l,a}$ can be estimated externally and input as fixed matrices for each survey and fishery. In future milestones, this framework will allow us flexibility to estimate growth and length-based selectivity without needing to update this aspect of the observation model. It will also allow us to include a range of parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric growth functions using random effects (Correa et al., 2023). In order to speed up optimization once growth is estimated, methods should be developed to make the $\phi$ matrices sparse. </mark>

## AK method

Marginal age and length compositions are often fit in bespoke ADMB models in Alaska. This approach relies on age-based selectivity functions, and growth is not estimated internally.

Predicted catch-at-age for year $y$ and fishery $f$ is calculated using element-wise multiplication

$$ \hat{C}_{y,f,a}=F_{y,f,a}N_{y,a}\frac{(1-\text{exp}(-Z_{y,a}))}{Z_{y,a}} $$

where $N_{y,a}$ is the abundance-at-age $a$ during year $y$, $Z_{y,a}$ is the total age-specific mortality for each year, and $F_{y,f,a}$ is the fleet-specific age-specific fishing mortality for each year.

Similarly, the predicted abundance-at-age $\hat{I}_{y,i,a}$ for the survey index is calculated as:

$$
\hat{I}_{y,i,a}=S_{y,i,a}N_{y,a}\text{exp}(-f_{y,a}Z_{y,a})
$$

where $f_{y,a}$ is the fraction of the year when the survey was conducted.

The predicted proportions-at-age (i.e., marginal age compositions) are obtained using:

$$ \hat{p}_{y,f,a}=\frac{\hat{C}_{y,f,a}}{\sum\limits_{a}{\hat{C}_{y,f,a}}} $$

These are converted to predicted proportions-at-length (i.e., marginal length compositions) using the dot product of $\hat{p}_{y,f,a}$ and the fleet-specific age-length transition matrix $\phi_{y,f,l,a}$:

$$ \hat{p}_{y,f,l}=\hat{p}_{y,f,a}\cdot\phi_{y,f,l,a} $$

Predicted survey age and length marginal compositions are obtained in an identical fashion using the age-length transition matrix specified for that survey.

<mark>**IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:** This method has the benefit of being very simple. The known drawbacks are that it does not currently include length-based selectivity, and at least in Alaska, growth (i.e., the age-length transition matrix) is not estimated internally. Extensions could be developed that include length-based selectivity; for example, that convert length-based selectivity to age-based selectivity using the transpose of the age-length transition matrix. When marginal length compositions are fit, this would require an extra dot product calculation in the conversion from $\hat{p}_{y,f,a}$ to $\hat{p}_{y,f,l}$. Note that the SS3 approach is doing the same calculations but doing so using element-wise multiplication and summing over lengths or ages to get marginal age or length compositions, respectively. In SS3, these calculations happen regardless of whether age or length-based selectivity is used. It is unclear if the element-wise multiplication approach in SS3 or the dot product </mark>

## SAM method

SAM is a state-space assessment model used in several ICES stock assessments (is the best citation Nielsen and Berg, 2014?).

$$
\text{log}\hat{C}_{y,f,a}=\text{log}F_{y,f,a}-\text{log}Z_{y,f,a}+\text{log}N_{y,a}+\text{log}(1-\text{exp}(-Z_{y,a}))
$$

... then extend just like AK method.

$$
\hat{C}_{y,l}=\hat{C}_{y,a}\cdot\phi_{y,l,a}
$$

Similarly could convert to $F_{y,f,l}$ if needed:

$$ F_{y,f,l}=F_{y,f,a}\cdot\phi_{y,f,l,a} $$

<mark>**IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:** This method has the benefit of being a purely state-space model and collapses the constructs of fishing mortality and selectivity, thus reducing model complexity in theory. A drawback of this approach is that we lose parametric selectivity functions that are prevalent in the U.S. It is currently unknown how well growth (i.e., the $\phi$ matrix) can be estimated internally). We don't know currently know the trade offs for efficiency.</mark>

## Fleet and population structure
To enable one fleet to act on multiple populations, we will need to calculate catch outside of the population loop.

Places we currently loop through fleets within a population:
* Population->Prepare loops through Fleet->Prepare
* CalculateMortality loops through fleets to sum up F*s
* CalculateCatch sums up catch weight-at-age and also expected catch
* CalculateIndex 
* CalculateCatchNAA
* CalculateCatchWAA
Reports: expected index, catch numbers-at-age, catch weight-at-age

Fleet-> and Population-> Prepare set values to zero - don't reinitialize for each population.
